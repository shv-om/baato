This is a sample code for sharing files form one windows system to another system using the Wifi Direct.
This code is capable of sharing files at a speed of 40 Mb/s.

Note: Speed increases when both the devices are connected without Internet connection. (hostednetwork adapter in windows 10)

Just an example of how peer to peer connections work using Python3

How to use:
1. Just start hotspot manually from one system. (Host)
2. Connect to the host system from an another system. (Client)
3. Put socket_server.exe on host system and socket_client.exe file on client system
4. First run server and then client executables in respective system.
5. Sit back as your transfer is happening.
